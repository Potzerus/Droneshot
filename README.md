# Droneshot

Droneshot is a discord bot created for the Discord hackweek, which takes place from june 24th up until june 28th
The aim of this bot is to provide the ability to play a game concept which is based on users gathering materials and using them to build drones, however due to time constraints We've only managed to implement basic functionality but we will extend this after hackweek
